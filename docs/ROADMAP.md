## High Priority - Core Features

### 1. Wire CLI Flags into Single-Task Execution ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Partially Implemented
**Location:** `internal/runner/runner.go`, `cmd/cliffy/main.go`

**Current State:**
- Flags are parsed but Runner implementation is minimal
- Thinking display not implemented in single-task path
- Stats display works but limited

**Needed:**
- Full streaming implementation in Runner
- Wire `--show-thinking` to display reasoning in real-time
- Wire `--thinking-format` (json/text)
- Consistent behavior between single-task and volley paths

**Improvement Report Reference:** #1

### 2. Complete Diff Output Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Declared but not implemented
**Location:** `internal/output/formatter.go:288-292`

**Current State:**
```go
func FormatDiffOutput(results interface{}) string {
    // TODO: Implement in improvement #2
    return "Diff output not yet implemented\n"
}
```

**Needed:**
- Extract diffs from tool metadata
- Format unified diff output
- Show only files modified with before/after
- Support `--output-format diff` flag

**Improvement Report Reference:** #2

---

### 3. Enhanced Stats Display ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Partially Implemented
**Location:** `cmd/cliffy/main.go`, `internal/volley/scheduler.go`

**Current State:**
- Stats tracked but `--stats` flag behavior incomplete
- Quiet mode suppresses all summary output
- Verbose mode shows detailed stats

**Needed:**
- `--stats` should work independently of verbosity
- Show token totals, cost, timing in dedicated stats section
- Don't hide failures in quiet mode
- Rich context for multi-task failures

**Improvement Report Reference:** #3

---

## Medium Priority - Developer Experience

### 4. STDIN and Task File Support üìã
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Mentioned In:** IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #5

**Needed:**
- Accept `-` to read tasks from STDIN
- Add `--tasks-file` flag for newline-separated prompts
- Support JSON task batches for complex workflows
- Enable shell pipeline integration

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# From STDIN
echo "analyze auth.go" | cliffy -

# From file
cliffy --tasks-file tasks.txt

# JSON batch
cat tasks.json | cliffy --tasks-file -
```

---

### 5. Per-Task Metadata Enrichment üìã
**Status:** Partially Implemented
**Location:** `internal/volley/task.go`, `cmd/cliffy/main.go`

**Current State:**
- Basic metadata tracked (tokens, duration, retries)
- Tool metadata collected
- Exit codes not exposed in output

**Needed:**
- Exit codes in JSON output
- Retry counts per task
- Tool invocation summaries
- Per-task timing breakdown

**Improvement Report Reference:** #6

---

### 6. Consolidate Single-Task and Volley Execution ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** In Progress
**Location:** `internal/runner/runner.go`, `cmd/cliffy/main.go:118-123`

**Current State:**
- Single task ‚Üí Runner (minimal implementation)
- Multiple tasks ‚Üí Volley (full featured)
- Inconsistent UX between paths

**Options:**
1. Enhance Runner with full streaming features
2. Route single tasks through Volley with concurrency=1
3. Fold streaming logic from planned Runner into Volley

**Improvement Report Reference:** #7

---

### 7. Interactive Setup Commands ‚úÖ Partially Done
**Status:** Implemented but can be enhanced
**Location:** `cmd/cliffy/doctor.go`, `cmd/cliffy/init.go`

**Current State:**
- `cliffy doctor` - exists and checks config
- `cliffy init` - exists and creates sample config

**Enhancement Ideas:**
- Verify API keys interactively
- Test provider connectivity
- Guide model selection
- Create `.cliffy/init` marker to skip repeats

**Improvement Report Reference:** #8

---

### 8. Built-In Task Templates & Presets ‚úÖ Partially Done
**Status:** Preset system implemented
**Location:** `internal/preset/preset.go`, `cmd/cliffy/preset.go`

**Current State:**
- Preset system exists and works
- Can apply presets to agents and models
- `cliffy preset list` command exists

**Enhancement Ideas:**
- Ship more curated presets (currently minimal)
- YAML/JSON preset files alongside binary
- Per-task preset overrides
- Preset examples: `fast-qa`, `deep-review`, `sec-review`, `perf-analysis`

**Improvement Report Reference:** #9

---

## Low Priority - Polish & Optimization

### 9. Adaptive Concurrency üìã
**Status:** Infrastructure exists, not utilized
**Location:** `internal/volley/scheduler.go:27-42,359-375`

**Current State:**
- Fields tracked: `currentConcurrent`, `successCount`, `failureCount`
- Health metrics available via `getHealthMetrics()` and `shouldBackoff()`
- Not currently used for adaptive behavior

**Potential Use:**
- Reduce concurrency when failure rate is high
- Increase concurrency when success rate is high
- Back off when hitting rate limits
- Thunder herd prevention beyond jitter

**Improvement Report Reference:** #11

---

### 10. Telemetry & Observability üìã
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Mentioned In:** Design docs, IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md

**Current State:**
- Tool traces can be emitted as NDJSON
- Progress tracking exists
- No centralized telemetry

**Potential Features:**
- Optional telemetry endpoint
- Metrics aggregation
- Performance profiling hooks
- Distributed tracing for debugging

**Notes:**
- Should be opt-in only
- Privacy-focused (no prompt content by default)
- Useful for CI/CD monitoring

---

### 11. Expanded Test Coverage üìã
**Status:** Partial
**Location:** Various `_test.go` files

**Current Coverage:**
- Volley scheduler: ‚úÖ Good coverage
- CLI flag plumbing: ‚ùå No tests
- Output formatting: ‚ùå No tests
- Progress rendering: ‚ùå No tests
- Runner: ‚ùå Minimal tests

**Needed:**
- Cobra command tests for flag combinations
- Unit tests for `FormatToolTrace`
- Snapshot tests for progress tracker
- Integration tests for full execution paths

**Improvement Report Reference:** #13

## Won't Implement (vs. Design Docs)

### HeadlessRunner Component
**Reason:** Implemented differently using Volley + Runner dual-path approach

### StreamingProcessor Component
**Reason:** Event processing handled directly in Scheduler and Agent

### DirectToolExecutor Component
**Reason:** Tool execution integrated into Agent system

### Title Generation
**Reason:** Removed intentionally (1.5s overhead, not needed for one-off tasks)

### Persistence Layer
**Reason:** Zero-persistence is core design principle
