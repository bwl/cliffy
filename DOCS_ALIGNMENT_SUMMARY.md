# Documentation Alignment Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Task:** Align docs with implementation (Improvement #12 from IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Overview

The documentation in `docs/` was originally written for a planned "crush-headless" project during the design phase. Cliffy has since been implemented with some differences from the original design. This summary details all changes made to align documentation with the actual implementation.

## Files Updated

### 1. docs/architecture.md ‚úÖ MAJOR UPDATE
**Status:** Completely updated to reflect current implementation

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced "Crush-Headless" branding with "Cliffy"
- ‚úÖ Updated high-level flow diagram to show Volley + Runner dual-path
- ‚úÖ Replaced non-existent components:
  - ‚ùå HeadlessRunner ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLI Entry Point + Runner + Volley
  - ‚ùå StreamingProcessor ‚Üí ‚úÖ Event processing in Scheduler/Agent
  - ‚ùå DirectToolExecutor ‚Üí ‚úÖ Agent system with tool execution
  - ‚ùå ThinkingFormatter ‚Üí ‚úÖ Progress tracker with inline thinking
  - ‚ùå OutputFormatter (as designed) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Actual output/formatter.go

  - Volley Scheduler (parallel task execution)
  - Agent System (LLM interaction)
  - Output Formatter (tool traces, JSON, NDJSON)
- ‚úÖ Updated execution flow to show actual single-task vs volley paths
- ‚úÖ Updated memory model with realistic numbers
- ‚úÖ Added header noting document status and last update date

**Notes Added:**
- Diff mode declared but not fully implemented (returns placeholder)
- Runner is minimal (full streaming planned but not yet done)
- See ROADMAP.md for unimplemented features

### 2. docs/implementation-guide.md ‚úÖ MARKED HISTORICAL
**Status:** Marked as historical design document

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Added prominent warning header marking document as historical
- ‚úÖ Explained this was the original "crush-headless" design
- ‚úÖ Noted actual implementation evolved differently (Volley pattern)
- ‚úÖ Added references to architecture.md and ROADMAP.md for current info

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED (architecture.md)
  - ‚≠ê NEW (ROADMAP.md)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è HISTORICAL (implementation-guide.md)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY OUTDATED (api-specification.md)
- ‚úÖ Replaced "proposed" examples with actual working commands
- ‚úÖ Updated performance comparison table with real vs planned numbers

- ‚úÖ Recently completed features
- ‚úÖ References to IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md for each item
- ‚úÖ Code locations for each feature
- ‚úÖ Contribution guidelines

**Purpose:** Central place to track all missing features mentioned in docs or referenced in code.

## Files NOT Updated (Preserved As-Is)

### Intentionally Preserved

1. **docs/api-specification.md**
   - Marked as "‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY OUTDATED" in README
   - Users directed to `cliffy --help` for accurate flags
   - JSON schemas still valid
   - Will be updated in future when features are implemented

2. **docs/performance-analysis.md**
   - Still relevant for benchmarking
   - Contains Crush vs Cliffy comparisons
   - No changes needed

3. **docs/model-selection.md**
   - Still accurate (describes `--fast`, `--smart`, `--preset`)
   - No changes needed

4. **docs/fork-strategy.md**
   - Still relevant for maintainers
   - No changes needed

5. **docs/crush-headless-overview.md**
   - Historical design document
   - Preserved for context
   - Not linked in README (to avoid confusion)

6. **docs/AGENT_BRIEFING.md**
   - Internal planning doc
   - Preserved for context

## Key Discrepancies Documented

### Features Mentioned in Docs but Not Implemented

**From architecture.md (original):**
1. ‚ùå HeadlessRunner component ‚Üí Uses Volley + Runner instead
2. ‚ùå StreamingProcessor component ‚Üí Event processing in Scheduler
3. ‚ùå DirectToolExecutor component ‚Üí Tool execution in Agent
4. ‚ùå ThinkingFormatter as separate component ‚Üí Inline in progress tracker
5. ‚ùå Full diff output mode ‚Üí Placeholder only (ROADMAP item #2)

**From implementation-guide.md:**
1. ‚ùå Parallel read-only tool execution ‚Üí Not implemented
2. ‚ùå Lazy LSP initialization ‚Üí LSP clients created but not lazy
3. ‚ùå Headless-specific prompt ‚Üí Uses Crush prompts with agent configs

**From api-specification.md:**
1. ‚ùå Full thinking JSON/text formatting ‚Üí Basic implementation only
2. ‚ùå Diff output format ‚Üí Returns placeholder
3. ‚ùå Some thinking-related features ‚Üí Partially working

### Features Working Better Than Designed

1. ‚úÖ **Smart Retry Logic** - Implemented with per-error backoff strategies (better than design)
2. ‚úÖ **Jitter in Retry** - Added ¬±25% jitter to prevent thundering herd
3. ‚úÖ **Adaptive Metrics** - Infrastructure for adaptive concurrency (not yet utilized)
4. ‚úÖ **Tool Traces** - NDJSON emission for automation (not in original design)
5. ‚úÖ **Preset System** - Full implementation (mentioned but not detailed in design)
6. ‚úÖ **Max Concurrent Override** - `--max-concurrent` flag added

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Contributors

1. **Check ROADMAP.md first** - See what's planned vs implemented
2. **Read architecture.md** - Understand current system design
3. **Reference IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md** - Detailed analysis of each gap
4. **Test before assuming** - Some features may work differently than docs describe

### For Maintainers

1. **Prioritize ROADMAP items** - Focus on high-priority gaps:
   - Wire CLI flags into single-task execution (#1)
   - Complete diff output mode (#2)
   - Enhanced stats display (#3)

2. **Update api-specification.md** - When features are implemented:
   - Remove crush-headless references
   - Mark implemented vs planned features
   - Update examples to match `cliffy --help`

3. **Consider removing** - Old design docs if they cause confusion:
   - crush-headless-overview.md (not linked, preserved for history)
   - AGENT_BRIEFING.md (internal planning doc)

4. **Keep up-to-date:**
   - Update ROADMAP.md as features are completed
   - Mark items ‚úÖ in ROADMAP when implemented
   - Add new planned features to appropriate priority level

### Issues to Create (Recommended)

Based on ROADMAP.md high-priority items:

1. **Issue: Wire CLI flags into single-task execution**
   - Labels: enhancement, priority:high
   - Description: Make `--show-thinking`, `--thinking-format`, `--stats` work in single-task mode
   - Reference: IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #1

2. **Issue: Implement diff output mode**
   - Labels: feature, priority:high
   - Description: Complete `FormatDiffOutput()` to extract and format diffs from tool metadata
   - Reference: IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #2

3. **Issue: Enhanced stats display**
   - Labels: enhancement, priority:high
   - Description: Make `--stats` work independently of verbosity, don't hide failures in quiet mode
   - Reference: IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #3

4. **Issue: STDIN and task file support**
   - Labels: feature, priority:medium, DX
   - Description: Accept tasks from STDIN (`-`) and files (`--tasks-file`)
   - Reference: IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #5

5. **Issue: Consolidate single-task and volley execution**
   - Labels: refactor, priority:medium
   - Description: Unify streaming logic between Runner and Volley paths
   - Reference: IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md #7

## Summary Statistics

**Documents Updated:** 4 files
- architecture.md (major update)
- implementation-guide.md (marked historical)
- docs/README.md (major rewrite)
- ROADMAP.md (new file)

**Documents Preserved:** 6 files
- api-specification.md (marked as partially outdated)
- performance-analysis.md
- model-selection.md
- fork-strategy.md
- crush-headless-overview.md (historical)
- AGENT_BRIEFING.md (internal)

**Features Documented:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented: 17 features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Done: 3 features
- üìã Planned: 11 features
- ‚ùå Won't Implement: 5 design components (replaced by different approach)

**References Added:**
- All ROADMAP items link to IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md sections
- All ROADMAP items include code locations
- Cross-references between docs for easy navigation

## Conclusion

Documentation now accurately reflects:
1. ‚úÖ What Cliffy is (not "crush-headless")
2. ‚úÖ What's implemented vs planned
3. ‚úÖ How the actual architecture differs from original design
4. ‚úÖ Where to find accurate information (ROADMAP, architecture.md)
5. ‚úÖ Historical context preserved for reference

Contributors will no longer chase "ghost features" - they can clearly see what exists, what's planned, and what was designed but evolved differently.
